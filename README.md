This repo consists of a number of machine learning and deep learning projects I did while completing the CALTECH AI and ML course offered by Simplilearn. Some notebooks are very big and may not open in GitHub. For such notebooks , i have also included a pdf file that has the source code. Some of the data is on my google drive . Please send a message here if you want access to the data.The data is also available on public domain
