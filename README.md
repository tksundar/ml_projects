## Introduction
This repo consists of a number of machine learning and deep learning projects I did while completing the CALTECH AI and ML course offered by Simplilearn. Some notebooks are very big and may not open in GitHub. For such notebooks , i have also included a pdf file that has the source code. Some of the data is on my google drive . Please send a message here if you want access to the data.The data is also available on public domain
### Projects

#### _Employee Turnover_

Predict the employee turnover based on various features in the given dataset. Use Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, RandoForestClassifer and GradientBoostClassifier

#### _Cohorts of Songs_

Using the spotify dataset with no target label, use K means Clustering and Principal Component Analysts to create cohorts of songs

#### _Lending Club_

Using ANN , predict the defaulters who have availed loans and compare performance with traditional ML models like Random Forest Classifier

####  _Housing Loan data Analysis_
For a safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyze the past data. In this project, we build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using historical data. As we will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

#### _Automatic Port operations( capstone project)_
**Objectives**

*  Identify different classes of boats using a Convolutional Neural Network model
*  Identify different classes of boats using the MobileNet_V2 model using transfer learning
*   Compare the performance of the performances  of both and draw inferences

#### _Historical Structure identification and Recommender system(capstone project)_

In part 1, Using CNN and Transfer learning , identify the various historical structures. In part 2, using the rating data  and cosine similarity, device a recommender system that can recommend places to visit to a prospective tourist

#### _Autonomous Driving(capstone project)_

In part 1, train a YOLO model with custom vehecle data and use the trained model to detect vehicle objects by drawing appropriate labeled bounding boxes. In part 2, analyse the various causes for accidents in Tesla self driving cars
